> The seed project for AngularJS and Angular Material


## Whats so special?

This seed project, when it is finished, will be a fully baked reference project
with all the cool tools and scripts to help you develop AngularJS apps. It is
going to be heavily based on industry standards and best practices. Mainly, I
want it to be a good resource for budding developers.

(That is what I am hoping for anyway ^ãƒ¼^)


## Why AngularJS and Angular Material?

Well because they are built by Google engineers, they must know what they are
doing right?
